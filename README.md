# CXFClient_ImageCat
This repository uses my forked version of Apache Tika to process the index obtained from imagecat and retrieves named entites by making a call to NLTKRest


You must clone two of my repositories :
Tika NLTKRest

mvn build apache Tika and update the pom.xml to use this tika-app jar
